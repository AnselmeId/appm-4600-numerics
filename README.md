# Numerical Analysis Class, APPM 4600
Undergraduate "Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing", first semester, APPM 4600. University of Colorado Boulder

This is the lab solutions branch, which only has solutions to the labs. You probably want the `main` branch

(Note: labs are pass/fail, so solutions are public but we encourage students to attempt the lab first without looking at solutions)

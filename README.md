## Similar classes

- The second semester continuation of this class is APPM 4610
- This class was created around 2022 to replace APPM/MATH 4600 "Intermediate Numerical Analysis" (and APPM 4610 replaces APPM/MATH 4610)
  - As part of this change, the sequence of topics (what is covered first semester, what is covered second semester) has changed somewhat; we now skip Ch 5 in Burden and Faires, and add in some of Ch 10 and bits of Ch 8 and 9 (and even 7)

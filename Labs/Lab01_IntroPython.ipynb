        "- To run Python locally, do one of the following methods (do at least one, but we suggest trying several):\n",
        "  - From the command line or powershell, run a Python script, like `python myscript.py`\n",
        "  - Run [IPython](https://ipython.org/) from the command line\n",
        "    - This opens up a [REPL environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) much like Matlab, and lets you interactively code. This is nice for plots\n",
        "    - Fun fact: this was developed by [Fernando Pérez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_P%C3%A9rez_(software_developer)) when he was a grad student at CU Boulder in the early 2000s\n",
        "  - Run a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which lets you run `.ipynb` files. This is the modern extension of iPython\n",
        "  - Run a [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) session. This is an extension of Jupyter notebook that gives the features of an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).  **recommended**\n",
        "  - Use an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) like VSCode, PyCharm, Spyder\n",
        "    - As of 2025, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) dominates the market, and using VSCode efficiently is a skill employers value, so we highly **recommend** it.  It can edit pure Python file (`.py`) as well as jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`)\n",

        "### Get Python to run on a **cloud** server\n",
        "- Computer Science majors have access to the CS cloud servers\n",

        "  - Pro tip #2: in Python, when installing packages, do it with virtual environent, either with the package manager `conda` (which comes with Anaconda), or with `pip` and `venv`.  This way, if you have some packages that conflict or get into isues with dependencies, it only affects your current \"environment\", so it won't mess up your operating system and it won't affect other projects (say, for a different class or different assignment)\n",
